<h2>Welcome to MSB-Java version 1.4.3</h2>

<h3>February 09, 2016</h3>

<pre>MSB-Java version 1.4.3 contains minor improvements.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Features of MSB-Java version 1.4.3:
   - Added logging support: all message tags concatenated into one string can be added to consumers thread
     MDC (see http://www.slf4j.org/api/org/slf4j/MDC.html) in 'msbTags' field. Message tags that have key-value format
     (e.g. 'requestId:123456' or 'requestId-123456') can be added to consumers thread MDC as separate properties where
     part before delimiter is a key and part after delimiter is a value. Delimiter is configurable. MDC is cleared
     after message handler invocation return;
   - it is possible to define a messages forwarding namespace for requests;
   - Requester API now allows to publish message with multiple tags.

Features of MSB-Java version 1.4.2:
   - the library uses only slf4j API for logging
     so log4j dependency is no longer included;
   - logback dependency is included for testing only;
   - dependencies updates.

Features of MSB-Java version 1.4.0:
   - Added prefetch count for AMQP adapter
     (for details see https://www.rabbitmq.com/consumer-prefetch.html);
   - Implemented explicit confirm/reject delivered messages;
   - Fixed an issue when `onEnd` callback could be invoked by timeout while not all incoming responses are processed yet;
   - Fixed an issue when time-consuming `onResponse` callbacks could block incoming responses processing;
   - Acceptance testing is enabled by default during a build.

Features of MSB-Java version 1.3.0:
   - Removed REST-style payload constraint on parameters type;
   - Updated Requester behavior. It waits for acks even if configured to
     `waitForResponses: 0`.
